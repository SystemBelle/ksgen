README

Ksgen - A Ruby/Sinatra program to generate Kickstart files based on the given
URL from HAML templates.


START

  Start in the foreground

	ruby ksgen.rb

  or the background, a simple way to "daemonize" it

	nohup ruby ksgen.rb &> ksgen.log &

  Other methods such as init scripts or Unicorn can also be used.



USAGE

  Navigate to a URL valid for your setup, they can be simple if defaults are used

	http://localhost:4567/centos/5/raid0

  or a little more complex when needed

	http://localhost:4567/centos5/singlepart?snippet=swapfile&arch=x86_64&datacenter=office



URL STRUCTURE

	OS Profile / Disk Profile ? Optional Parameters


  Available Query Parameters

  CPU Architecture = arch
  Location = location
  Snippets = snippet



OS PROFILES

  An OS profile provides the layout of the generated Kickstart file and should mostly contain variables that expand
  into snippet names.



DISK PROFILES

  A disk profile is simply a snippet containing the disk partitioning portion of Kickstart profiles, the part typically
  written to /tmp/partinfo.

The disk profile must be specified in the OS profile as shown here to function
as a variable with a value from the URL

	<%= erb :"#{@disk_profile}" %>



TEMPLATES

  Templates define the layout of smaller snippets of ERB.



SNIPPETS

  Snippets are written in ERB, so for simple snippets that do not require
  interpolation of Ruby code it is simply plain text.
